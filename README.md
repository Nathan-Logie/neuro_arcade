# NeuroArcade

## Description
NeuroArcade is a web project developed by SH08 as part of the Professional Software Development course at the University of Glasgow. The website will allow for a centralised system to record the results of AI models in Games and for a direct comparison with other models. Models will be ranked comparatively (How similar to humans) and competitively (Performance compared to other models).

The ultimate goal is to help make cognitive science more openly collaborative.
